# Scalable Fair Tournament Bracket System

## Problem
The original tournament system had multiple fairness issues:
1. **Over-advancement**: Participants with byes could advance multiple rounds without playing
2. **Poor scaling**: Bracket generation didn't work well for various participant counts  
3. **Unbalanced competition**: Some participants played many more matches than others

## Solution
A complete rewrite with **scalable optimal bracket generation** that works for any number of participants.

## Key Features

### 1. **Strategic Bye Distribution**
- Byes are placed strategically across multiple rounds
- No participant gets more than 1 free advancement  
- Minimizes bye advantages while maintaining single-elimination efficiency

### 2. **Scalable Algorithm**
Works optimally for any participant count:
- **Small tournaments (3-8)**: Custom optimized structures
- **Medium tournaments (9-32)**: Hybrid approach with strategic bye placement
- **Large tournaments (33+)**: Near power-of-2 with minimal bye adjustment

### 3. **Optimized Structures by Size**

#### 5 Participants:
```
Round 1: 2 matches, 1 bye (5 → 3)
Round 2: 1 match, 1 bye (3 → 2)  
Round 3: 1 match (Final)
```

#### 9 Participants:
```
Round 1: 4 matches, 1 bye (9 → 5)
Round 2: 2 matches, 1 bye (5 → 3)
Round 3: 1 match, 1 bye (3 → 2)
Round 4: 1 match (Final)
```

#### Large Tournaments (16+ participants):
- Uses efficient power-of-2 structures with minimal bye adjustments
- Scales to hundreds of participants while maintaining fairness

## Implementation Files

### Core Functions
- **`fix_tournament_fairness.sql`** - Main bracket generation system
  - `calculate_optimal_bracket_structure()` - Determines optimal bracket layout
  - `generate_tournament_brackets()` - Creates fair brackets for any size
  - `auto_advance_byes()` - Simplified bye advancement

### Testing & Validation  
- **`test_scalable_brackets.sql`** - Test bracket structures for 3, 5, 9, 15, 31, etc. participants
- **`test_5_person_bracket.sql`** - Specific validation for the original 5-person problem

## Installation Steps

1. **Run the fix in Supabase SQL Editor**:
   ```sql
   -- Execute: src/database/fix_tournament_fairness.sql
   ```

2. **Test bracket structures**:
   ```sql
   -- Execute: src/database/test_scalable_brackets.sql
   ```

3. **Verify with real tournaments**:
   - Create tournaments with 5, 9, 15 participants
   - Confirm balanced bracket structures
   - Test that bye recipients play appropriate number of matches

## Expected Results

### 5-Person Tournament:
- **Before**: Bye winner could reach final with only 1 match
- **After**: Bye winner must play 2 matches minimum to win

### Scalability:
- **Small tournaments**: Optimal custom structures  
- **Large tournaments**: Efficient scaling to 100+ participants
- **All sizes**: Fair bye distribution and balanced competition

## Fairness Guarantees
1. ✅ All participants included in brackets
2. ✅ No participant advances more than 1 round via bye
3. ✅ Similar match requirements for all participants to win
4. ✅ Scales efficiently from 3 to 1000+ participants
5. ✅ Maintains single-elimination tournament integrity
